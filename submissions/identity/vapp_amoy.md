## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: NovaVault  
- **Category**: DeFi / Infrastructure

### Description
NovaVault is a decentralized application that allows users to securely store, manage, and swap assets across multiple blockchains. It addresses the problem of fragmented liquidity and complex bridging by providing a unified, intuitive interface with built-in cross-chain swap functionality.

### SL Integration
NovaVault integrates the Soundness Layer to ensure:  
- **Transaction Soundness Proofs** for secure swaps  
- **Cross-Chain Messaging** for reliable interoperability  
- **Decentralized Identity Verification** for safer onboarding and reduced fraud  

## Technical

### Architecture
The architecture includes:  
- A React-based frontend connected to a Node.js backend.  
- Smart contracts managing vaults and swaps on-chain.  
- Soundness Layer modules for validation and secure messaging.  
- IPFS for metadata storage, with WALRUS for resilient backups.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer + EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, Base, Polygon)  
- **Storage**: IPFS + WALRUS  

### Features
1. Unified multi-chain asset vault dashboard  
2. Cross-chain swaps with SL-powered proofs  
3. Identity-verified transactions for enhanced trust  

## Timeline

### PoC (2–4 weeks)
- [ ] Implement core vault functionality  
- [ ] Integrate basic SL proof validation  
- [ ] Develop minimal React UI  

### MVP (4–8 weeks)  
- [ ] Enable multi-chain swap support  
- [ ] Expand SL integration (messaging + identity)  
- [ ] Conduct user testing with early adopters  

## Innovation
NovaVault is unique in combining secure vault storage with seamless cross-chain swaps in one vApp. Leveraging SL proofs and identity modules, it mitigates risks of malicious bridges while improving DeFi accessibility. This simplicity and security together create a compelling reason for users to adopt NovaVault over fragmented alternatives.
